# Week 02 Lab - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

# Define the choices array
choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]

# Get player input
playerChoice = input("Enter your choice (1=Rock, 2=Paper, 3=Scissors): ")

# Error handling for player choice
if playerChoice < 1 or playerChoice > 3:
    print("Error: Choice must be between 1 and 3.")
else:
    # Get computer choice (simulated input)
    computerChoice = input("Enter computer's choice (1-3): ")
    computerChoice = int(computerChoice)

    # Error handling for computer choice
    if computerChoice < 1 or computerChoice > 3:
        print("Error: Choice must be between 1 and 3.")
    else:
        # Array indexing (subtract 1 because list starts at index 0)
        playerName = choices[playerChoice - 1]
        computerName = choices[computerChoice - 1]

        print("You chose:", playerName)
        print("Computer chose:", computerName)

        # Determine winner
